# Embedded Systems Programming on ARM Cortex-M3/M4 ‚öôÔ∏è

This repository is used for learning and practicing embedded systems programming on ARM Cortex-M3/M4 microcontrollers, based on the course [Embedded Systems Programming on ARM Cortex-M3/M4](https://www.udemy.com/course/embedded-system-programming-on-arm-cortex-m3m4/). It focuses on bare-metal programming, exception handling, interrupt management, writing startup files, linker scripts, and system-level low-level techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE (or equivalent)  
- **Toolchain:** arm-none-eabi-gcc  
- **Debugger:** ST-Link  
- **Language:** C (bare-metal) & Assembly  
- **Board:** STM32F4xx series (e.g., STM32F407 Discovery)

## üéØ What You Will Learn

- Internal architecture of ARM Cortex-M3/M4 processors  
- Mixed C and Assembly programming using inline assembly  
- Memory structure, bus interfaces, NVIC, and exception handling  
- Low-level interrupt configuration and system exception control  
- Writing IRQ handlers, managing IRQ numbers, priority and preemption  
- Implementing simple schedulers using PendSV and SysTick  
- Context switching and stack frame management  
- Creating startup files and linker scripts from scratch  
- Complete bare-metal build process  
- Fault exceptions, fault handler implementation and analysis  
- ARM AAPCS calling convention and stack usage  
- GCC-specific techniques: naked functions, variable and section attributes  

---

## üìé Requirements

- Basic knowledge of C programming  
- Familiarity with STM32 or ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers  
- STM32CubeIDE installed and configured  
- A compatible STM32 development board
